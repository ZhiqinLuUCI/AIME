<p id="azF">While walking through a fictional forest, you encounter three trolls guarding a bridge. Each is either a <em class="emphasis">knight</em>, who always tells the truth, or a <em class="emphasis">knave</em>, who always lies. The trolls will not let you pass until you correctly identify each as either a knight or a knave. Each troll makes a single statement:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote" id="RmX">
<p id="vxP">Troll 1: If I am a knave, then there are exactly two knights here.</p>
<p id="bEY">Troll 2: Troll 1 is lying.</p>
<p id="HMh">Troll 3: Either we are all knaves or at least one of us is a knight.</p>

Perhaps your experience with mathematics so far has mostly involved finding answers to problems. As we embark towards more advanced and abstract mathematics, writing will play a more prominent role in the mathematical process.</p>
<p id="SVg">Communication in mathematics requires more precision than many other subjects, and thus we should take a few pages here to consider the basic building blocks: <em class="emphasis">mathematical statements</em>.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="wKm"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

<p id="NfU"> A <dfn class="terminology">statement</dfn> is any declarative sentence which is either true or false. A statement is <dfn class="terminology">atomic</dfn> if it cannot be divided into smaller statements, otherwise it is called <dfn class="terminology">molecular</dfn>.</p>

</h4>
<p id="YKs">These are statements (in fact, <em class="emphasis">atomic</em> statements):</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li id="DTm"><p id="IhG">Telephone numbers in the USA have 10 digits.</p></li>
<li id="kav"><p id="ooP">The moon is made of cheese.</p></li>
<li id="QhE"><p id="UvY">42 is a perfect square.</p></li>
<li id="woN"><p id="ADh">Every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes.</p></li>
<li id="cvW"><p id="gKq"><span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle 3+7 = 12\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">And these are not statements:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li id="IDf"><p id="MRz">Would you like some cake?</p></li>
<li id="oKo"><p id="sYI">The sum of two squares.</p></li>
<li id="URx"><p id="p-derived-URx"><span class="process-math">\(1+3+5+7+\cdots+2n+1\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li id="AYG"><p id="ZfR">Go to your room!</p></li>
<li id="hfP"><p id="Fna"><span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle 3+x = 12\)</span></p></li>
</ul></article><p id="tnd"> The reason the sentence “<span class="process-math">\(3 + x = 12\)</span>” is not a statement is that it contains a variable. Depending on what <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is, the sentence is either true or false, but right now it is neither. One way to make the <em class="emphasis">sentence</em> into a <em class="emphasis">statement</em> is to specify the value of the variable in some way. This could be done by specifying a specific substitution, for example, “<span class="process-math">\(3+x = 12\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(x = 9\text{,}\)</span>” which is a true statement. Or you could <em class="emphasis">capture</em> the free variable by <em class="emphasis">quantifying</em> over it, as in, “for all values of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(3+x = 12\text{,}\)</span>” which is false. We will discuss quantifiers in more detail at the end of this section.</p>
<p id="Zum"> You can build more complicated (molecular) statements out of simpler (atomic or molecular) ones using <dfn class="terminology">logical connectives</dfn>. For example, this is a molecular statement:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote" id="JIy"><p id="nTq">Telephone numbers in the USA have 10 digits and 42 is a perfect square.</p></blockquote>
<p id="FBv"> Note that we can break this down into two smaller statements. The two shorter statements are <em class="emphasis">connected</em> by an “and.” We will consider 5 connectives: “and” (Sam is a man and Chris is a woman), “or” (Sam is a man or Chris is a woman), “if…, then…” (if Sam is a man, then Chris is a woman), “if and only if” (Sam is a man if and only if Chris is a woman), and “not” (Sam is not a man). The first four are called <dfn class="terminology">binary connectives</dfn> (because they connect two statements) while “not” is an example of a <dfn class="terminology">unary connective</dfn> (since it applies to a single statement).</p>
<p id="lIE"> These molecular statements are of course still statements, so they must be either true or false. The absolutely key observation here is that which <dfn class="terminology">truth value</dfn> the molecular statement achieves is completely determined by the type of connective and the truth values of the parts. We do not need to know what the parts actually say, only whether those parts are true or false. So to analyze logical connectives, it is enough to consider <dfn class="terminology">propositional variables</dfn> (sometimes called <em class="emphasis">sentential</em> variables), usually capital letters in the middle of the alphabet: <span class="process-math">\(P, Q, R, S, \ldots\text{.}\)</span> We think of these as standing in for (usually atomic) statements, but there are only two <em class="emphasis">values</em> the variables can achieve: true or false.<a href="" data-knowl="" class="id-ref fn-knowl original" data-refid="hk-fn-1" id="fn-1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> We also have symbols for the logical connectives: <span class="process-math">\(\wedge\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\vee\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\imp\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\iff\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\neg\text{.}\)</span></p>

<p id="QaA">An <dfn class="terminology">implication</dfn> or <dfn class="terminology">conditional</dfn> is a molecular statement of the form</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">

<p class="continuation">where <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> are statements. We say that</p>

<p id="whJ">An implication is <em class="emphasis">true</em> provided <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is false or <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is true (or both), and <em class="emphasis">false</em> otherwise. In particular, the only way for <span class="process-math">\(P \imp Q\)</span> to be false is for <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> to be true <em class="emphasis">and</em> <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> to be false.</p></article><p id="eef"> Easily the most common type of statement in mathematics is the implication. Even statements that do not at first look like they have this form conceal an implication at their heart. Consider the <em class="emphasis">Pythagorean Theorem</em>. Many a college freshman would quote this theorem as “<span class="process-math">\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\text{.}\)</span>” This is absolutely not correct. For one thing, that is not a statement since it has three variables in it. Perhaps they imply that this should be true for any values of the variables? So <span class="process-math">\(1^2 + 5^2 = 2^2\text{???}\)</span> How can we fix this? Well, the equation is true as long as <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are the legs of a right triangle and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> is the hypotenuse. In other words:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote" id="pPH"><p id="Uaz"><em class="emphasis">If</em> <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse <span class="process-math">\(c\text{,}\)</span> <em class="emphasis">then</em> <span class="process-math">\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\text{.}\)</span></p></blockquote>
<p id="Klo">This is a reasonable way to think about implications: our claim is that the conclusion (“then” part) is true, but on the assumption that the hypothesis (“if” part) is true. We make no claim about the conclusion in situations when the hypothesis is false.<a href="" data-knowl="" class="id-ref fn-knowl original" data-refid="hk-fn-2" id="fn-2"><sup> 2 </sup></a></p>
<p id="qsx">Still, it is important to remember that an implication is a statement, and therefore is either true or false. The truth value of the implication is determined by the truth values of its two parts. To agree with the usage above, we say that an implication is true either when the hypothesis is false, or when the conclusion is true. This leaves only one way for an implication to be false: when the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false.</p>

<p id="ERB">Consider the statement:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote" id="UhD"><p id="AhI">If Bob gets a 90 on the final, then Bob will pass the class.</p></blockquote>
<p id="kYK">This is definitely an implication: <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is the statement “Bob gets a 90 on the final,” and <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is the statement “Bob will pass the class.”</p>
<p id="RfT">Suppose I made that statement to Bob. In what circumstances would it be fair to call me a liar? What if Bob really did get a 90 on the final, and he did pass the class? Then I have not lied; my statement is true. However, if Bob did get a 90 on the final and did not pass the class, then I lied, making the statement false. The tricky case is this: what if Bob did not get a 90 on the final? Maybe he passes the class, maybe he doesn't. Did I lie in either case? I think not. In these last two cases, <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> was false, and the statement <span class="process-math">\(P \imp Q\)</span> was true. In the first case, <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> was true, and so was <span class="process-math">\(P \imp Q\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(P \imp Q\)</span> is true when either <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is false or <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is true.</p></article><p id="WzG">Just to be clear, although we sometimes read <span class="process-math">\(P \imp Q\)</span> as “<span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> <em class="emphasis">implies</em> <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span>”, we are not insisting that there is some causal relationship between the statements <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{.}\)</span> In particular, if you claim that <span class="process-math">\(P \imp Q\)</span> is <em class="emphasis">false</em>, you are not saying that <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> does not imply <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{,}\)</span> but rather that <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is true and <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is false.</p>

<p id="coS">To prove an implication <span class="process-math">\(P \imp Q\text{,}\)</span> it is enough to assume <span class="process-math">\(P\text{,}\)</span> and from it, deduce <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{.}\)</span></p></article><p id="iNY">Perhaps a better way to say this is that to prove a statement of the form <span class="process-math">\(P \imp Q\)</span> directly, you must explain why <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is true, but you <em class="emphasis">get to</em> assume <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is true first.

<p id="bjz">An implication is a way of expressing a relationship between two statements. It is often interesting to ask whether there are other relationships between the statements. Here we introduce some common language to address this question.</p>
<article class="assemblage assemblage-like" id="NIx"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Converse and Contrapositive.</span></h4>
<ul id="Iwb" class="disc">
<li id="Pcl"><p id="izD">The <dfn class="terminology">converse</dfn>  of an implication <span class="process-math">\(P \imp Q\)</span> is the implication <span class="process-math">\(Q \imp P\text{.}\)</span> The converse is NOT logically equivalent to the original implication. That is, whether the converse of an implication is true is independent of the truth of the implication.</p></li>
<li id="vju"><p id="OGM">The <dfn class="terminology">contrapositive</dfn>  of an implication <span class="process-math">\(P \imp Q\)</span> is the statement <span class="process-math">\(\neg Q \imp \neg P\text{.}\)</span> An implication and its contrapositive are logically equivalent (they are either both true or both false).</p></li>
</ul></article><p id="HqI">Mathematics is overflowing with examples of true implications which have a false converse. If a number greater than 2 is prime, then that number is odd. However, just because a number is odd does not mean it is prime. If a shape is a square, then it is a rectangle. But it is false that if a shape is a rectangle, then it is a square.</p>
<p id="nxR">However, sometimes the converse of a true statement is also true. For example, the Pythagorean theorem has a true converse: if <span class="process-math">\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\text{,}\)</span> then the triangle with sides <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> is a <em class="emphasis">right</em> triangle. Whenever you encounter an implication in mathematics, it is always reasonable to ask whether the converse is true.</p>
<p id="TFa">The contrapositive, on the other hand, always has the same truth value as its original implication. This can be very helpful in deciding whether an implication is true: often it is easier to analyze the contrapositive.</p>

An example of such a convention is to assume that sentences containing predicates with free variables are intended as statements, where the variables are universally quantified.</p>
<p id="rxQ">For example, do you believe that if a shape is a square, then it is a rectangle?  But how can that be true if it is not a statement?  To be a little more precise, we have two predicates: <span class="process-math">\(S(x)\)</span> standing for “<span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is a square” and <span class="process-math">\(R(x)\)</span> standing for “<span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is a rectangle”.  The <em class="emphasis">sentence</em> we are looking at is,</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
S(x) \imp R(x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">This is neither true nor false, as it is not a statement.  But come on!  We all know that we meant to consider the statement,</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\forall x (S(x) \imp R(x))\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">and this is what our convention tells us to consider.</p>
<p id="XEZ">Similarly, we will often be a bit sloppy about the distinction between a predicate and a statement.  For example, we might write, <em class="emphasis">let <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> be the <em class="emphasis">statement</em>, “<span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is prime,”</em> which is technically incorrect.  It is implicit that we mean that we are defining <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> to be a predicate, which for each <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> becomes the statement, <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is prime.</p></section><article class="example example-like" id="example-10"><h4 class="heading">
