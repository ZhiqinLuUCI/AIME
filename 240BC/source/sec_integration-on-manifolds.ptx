  <title>Integration on manifolds</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
     Let <m>M</m> be an
     <m>n</m>-dimensional manifold and let <m>\omega</m> be an <m>n</m>-form on <m>M</m> with compact 
     support. The integration of <m>\omega</m> over <m>M</m> can be defined in the following way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>\{U_j\}</m> be a locally finite cover of <m>M</m> and let <m>\{\rho_j\}</m> be the
       partition of unity subordinating to the cover. That is
<ol>
<li> <m>\rho_j\geq 0</m>;</li>
<li><m>{\rm supp}\,\rho_i\subset U_j</m> for all <m>j</m></li>
<li><m>\sum _j\rho_j=1.</m></li>
</ol>
    </p>
  </introduction>
<p>
 Then we can define
<me>
\int_M\omega=\sum_j\int_{U_j}\rho_j\,\omega,
</me>
where the right hand side is a sum of integrations on Euclidean space, hence well defined.  

</p>

<problem permid="LTX">
      <idx><h>recurrence relation</h><h>finding for sequence</h></idx>
      <statement>
        <p permid="pQu">
          Prove that  the definition of integral is independent to the choices of cover and the partition of unity.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution permid="cSi">
        <p permid="qVN">
          Finding the recurrence relation would be easier if we had some context for the problem
          (like the Tower of Hanoi, for example).
          Alas, we have only the sequence.
          Remember, the recurrence relation tells you how to get from previous terms to future terms.
          What is going on here?
          We could look at the differences between terms:
          <m>4, 12, 36, 108, \ldots</m>.
          Notice that these are growing by a factor of 3.
          Is the original sequence as well? <m>1\cdot 3 = 3</m>,
          <m>5 \cdot 3 = 15</m>, <m>17 \cdot 3 = 51</m> and so on.
          It appears that we always end up with 2 less than the next term.
          Aha!
        </p>

        <p permid="XcW">
          So <m>a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 2</m> is our recurrence relation and the initial condition is <m>a_0 = 1</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </problem>

   <p>
 The definition of integration can be generalized to manifold with boundary. A manifold with boundary  is a topological space such that</p>
<ol>
<li> It  can be covered by  <m>\{U_j\}</m>, where <m>U_j</m> is either the unit ball of <m>\mathbb R^n</m>, or the upper half of the unit ball of <m>\mathbb R^n</m> defined by
<me>
\{(x_1,\cdots,x_n)\mid\sum x_i^2\lt 1,x_n\geq 0\}.
</me>
</li>
<li>The transition functions are smooth (up to the boundary).</li>
</ol>

      After the last subsection, you might have a conclusion.
